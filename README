perf based replacement for autofdo to generate profile feedback data for gcc's -fauto-profile option.

Eventual goal is to support an online modus that supports contiguous profiling of the system
and then rebuilding pieces with profile feedback.

Requires a perf tool with the patches in
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ak/linux-misc.git/log/?h=perf/brstack-resolve-1

Synopsis:

gcc -g -O2 -o workload ...
perf record -b -c 100003 -e branches:upp workload
gcov.py --binary workload --gcov file.gcov
gcc -fauto-profile=file.gcov -o workload.opt -O2 -g ...

Status:

Should work for basic operations, but still various issues and needs more testing.
